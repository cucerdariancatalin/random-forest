# random-forest
Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It creates a collection of decision trees and combines their results to make a final prediction. The algorithm randomly selects features and samples, creating diverse trees that help reduce overfitting and improve the overall accuracy of the model.
